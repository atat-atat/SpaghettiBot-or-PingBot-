The Gossip Group Discord server is a place where you can socialize with other users.
If you would like to speak with a developer, you can mention them.
(via doing @ and then their name. EX: @person)
If you would like to know who the developers are, just type !developers.

!help is also a great source for command information, just type it in the chat.
We occasionally have a "radio station," where either PingBot,
or a specific user streams music in, GrooveClub FM, or PingBot AM.
To join a channel, simply click on a voice channel. (If you would like a screenshot-demonstration,
type !notes voice.)

If you would like to help contribute to a project, you can type !build to download the latest build of the current
project, and use !report ;aos ;<TEXT> to report a problem.
You can also talk with the developers if you would like to contribute work other than testing.
